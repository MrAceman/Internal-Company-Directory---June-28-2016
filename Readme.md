## Internal Company Directory - Importing live data using ajax. Intro to APIs

This HTML, CSS, and JS was created on June 28th, 2016.  The goal was to take make an ajax call to retrieve live JSON data (from randomuser.me) and dynamically create a page using the visual mockup provided by Brit.

The primary purposes of this exercise were to examine the API and work on using the ajax call and associated "then" to ensure that data would be returned prior to attempting to populate the page.
